# Titanic Dataset Exploploration
## By Amira Sayed

## Dataset

>Contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. The titanic dataframe describes the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. The titanic dataframe does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers.


## Summary of Findings
>I found that, the female passangers were more survived than male passeangers and, the number of 3rd class passengers is more than the total number of the other classes.So, The most Died Passengers were in this class.


## Key Insights for Presentation
> First, I showed the Gender Composition in Passengers and Gender Composition in Survived Passengers by using bar charts and pie charts, The comparision between the numbers of tickets in each class and found out that: 
- The number of the 3rd class passengers is more than the total number of the other classes.

> Second, the distributions between each passenger classes and its fares, I found that:
- The majority of the 3rd class fares were between 0 dollar and 10 dollars.
- The majority of the 2nd class fares were between 10 dollars and 20 dollars.
- The majority of the 1st class fares were between 30 dollars and 40 dollars.

> Then, The Embarkation ports proportion for each class, I found that:
- The 3rd class was the most class in all Emabrkation Ports.

> The Embarkation ports proportion for Survived and Died Passengers, I found that:
- The Embarktaion Port "S" had the most Survived and Died passengers.

> The Survived and Died proportion for each class, I found that:
- The most Died Passengers were in the 3rd class. 
- The most Survived Passengers were in the 1st class.

> Finaly, The age distribution for Survived Passengers and Died Passengers, I found that:
- IT was actually similar, but The difference between them is that, of the Died Passengers, a larger proportion were children
